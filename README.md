# First_Neural_Network


# Project Overview

This project is to understand and build a neural network from scratch without libraries like tensorflow or keras.
The data which is used to make a predictions is a bike rental statistic wich is explained in detail in a readme in the data folder.

# Packages

For this jupyter notebook to run you need these common packages: Pyhton 3.6, jupyter notebook, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.

# Files

day.csv, hour.csv, readme.txt : csv files with bike rental data, both are explained in the readme.txt

Your_first_neural_network.ipynb: a jupyter notebook with the application of the neural network

my_answers.py: file for python class with attributes and methods to create the neural network


# Conclusion, Findings

The neural network works well when then the data it was trained on is sufficient. If the data is sparse the prediction becomes unusable.
